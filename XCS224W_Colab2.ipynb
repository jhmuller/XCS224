    "## Building + Debugging Notes\n",
    "While working through this Colab and future Colabs, we strongly encourage you to follow a couple of building / debugging strategies:\n",
    "- During debugging make sure to run your notebook using the CPU runtime. You can change the notebook runtime by selecting `Runtime` and then `Change runtime type`. From the dropdown, select `None` as the `hardware accelerator`.\n",
    "- When working with PyTorch and Neural Network models, understanding the shapes of different tensors, especially the input and output tensors is incredibly helpful.\n",
    "- When training models, it is helpful to start by only running 1 epoch or even just a couple of batch iterations. This way you can check that all your tensor shapes and logic match up, while also tracking expected behavior, such as a decreasing training loss. Remember to comment out / save the default number of epochs that we provide you.\n"
