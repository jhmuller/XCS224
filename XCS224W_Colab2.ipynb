        "- When training models, it is helpful to start by only running 1 epoch or even just a couple of batch iterations. This way you can check that all your tensor shapes and logic match up, while also tracking expected behavior, such as a decreasing training loss. Remember to comment out / save the default number of epochs that we provide you.\n"
