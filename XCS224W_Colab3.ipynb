    "- During debugging make sure to run your notebook using the CPU runtime. You can change the notebook runtime by selecting `Runtime` and then `Change runtime type`. From the dropdown, select `None` as the `hardware accelerator`.\n",
    "- When working with PyTorch and Neural Network models, understanding the shapes of different tensors, especially the input and output tensors is incredibly helpful.\n",
    "- When training models, it is helpful to start by only running 1 epoch or even just a couple of batch iterations. This way you can check that all your tensor shapes and logic match up, while also tracking expected behavior, such as a decreasing training loss. Remember to comment out / save the default number of epochs that we provide you.\n"

    "## Creating Your Own Message Passing Layer\n",
    "\n",
    "Now it is time to implement your own message passing layers! Working through this part will help you become acutely familiar with the behind the scenes work of implementing Pytorch Message Passing Layers, allowing you to build you own custom GNN models. In doing so, you will work with and implement <br><b>3 critcal functions</b> needed to define a PyG Message Passing Layer:\n",
    "<ol><li>`forward`, <li> `message`, and <li>`aggregate`.</ol>\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving head first into the coding details, let us quickly review the key components of the message passing process.   \n",
    "\n",
    "### Central node message Passing\n",
    "First, we focus on a single round of messsage passing with respect to a single node $x$, which we refer to as the central node. The goal of the $lth$ layer of message passing is to update $x$'s feature vector from $x^{l-1}$ to $x^l$. To do so, we implement the following steps:  \n",
    "<ol>\n",
    "    <li>each neighboring node $v$ passes its current message $v^{l-1}$ across the edge $(v, x)$, \n",
    "    <li> for the node $x$, we aggregate all the messages of neighboring nodes (for example through a sum or mean),\n",
    "     <li> we transform the aggregated information by e.g. applying linear and non-linear transformations. \n",
    " </ol>  \n",
    " Altogether, the message passing process is applied such that every node $u$ in our graph updates its embedding through acting as the central node $x$ in step 1-3 described above. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Propagating and Transforming\n",
    "Second, let's apply this process of propagating and transforming information within the graph to that of coding a single message passing layer. Overall, the general paradigm of message passing layers is:  \n",
    "<ol> \n",
    "    <li> pre-processing\n",
    "    <li> **message passing** / propagation \n",
    "    <li>post-processing. \n",
    "</ol>\n",
    "The `forward` function that you will implement captures this execution logic. Namely, the `forward` function handles the pre and post-processing of node features / embeddings, as well as initiates message passing by calling the `propagate` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The `propagate` function encapsulates the actual message passing process within the graph! It does so by calling three important functions: \n",
    "<ol> \n",
    "    <li>`message`\n",
    "    <li>`aggregate`, and\n",
    "    <li>`update`. \n",
    " </ol>\n",
    " Your implementation will vary slightly from this, as you will not explicitly implement `update`, but instead place the logic for updating node embeddings after message passing and within the `forward` function. To be more specific, after information is propagated (message passing + aggregation), we can further transform the node embeddings outputed by `propagate`. Overall, the output of `forward` is exactly the node embeddings after one GNN layer.\n",
    " \n",
    "### side bar\n",
    "forward = pre-process + propogate + post-process<br>\n",
    "propogate = message + aggregate<br>\n",
    "post-process examples include transformations<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Putting it all together\n",
    "Lastly, before starting to implement our own layer, let us dig a bit deeper into each of the functions described above:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. \n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "def propagate(edge_index, x=(x_src, x_dst), extra=(extra_src, extra_dst), size=size):\n",
    "```\n",
    "Calling `propagate` initiates the message passing process. Looking at the function parameters, we highlight a couple of key parameters. \n",
    "\n",
    "  - `edge_index` is passed to the forward function and captures the edge structure of the graph. `edge_index` is of shape - `[2, E]`, where `edge_index[:, e]` represents a single edge $e$ in the graph.\n",
    "  - `x=(x_src, x_dst)` represents the node features that will be used in message passing, where we have the flexibility to distinguish the features of source (<b>x_src</b>) vs. destination (<b>x_dst</b>) nodes (e.g. with different transformations). Common notation is to think of the src node features as the node features used for sending messages and dst node features as the central node features that will be receiving these messages. Note, while in this notebook the src and dst matrices will be the same shape - $[N, d]$ (i.e. coming from the same set of nodes), we will see later in the course cases where these nodes can differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `extra=(extra_src, extra_dst)` represents additional information that we can associate with each node beyond its current feature embedding. In fact, we can include as many additional parameters of the form `param=(param_src, param_dst)` as we would like. We highlight that differentiating betwee `_src` and `_dst` allows us to differentiate the features used for central and neighboring node features later in the message passing process. \n",
    "\n",
    "  The output of the `propagate` function is a matrix of node embeddings after the message passing process and has shape $[N, d]$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. \n",
    "```\n",
    "def message(x_j, ...):\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `message` function is called by `propagate` and constructs the messages from neighboring nodes (src nodes) to central nodes (dst nodes). Following PyG convention, we subscript variables dealing with src nodes with `_j` and dst nodes  with `_i`. \n",
    "\n",
    "  - `x_j` represents the matrix of node features for *each src node of each edge* in the graph. Specifically, messages are constructed along each edge $(j, i) \\in \\mathcal{E}$, where edge_index is used extract node feature information to construct `x_j` as `x_j = x_src[edge_index[0, :], :]`. Thus, `x_j` has shape $[|\\mathcal{E}|, d]$!\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `...` represent any additional arguments passed to `propagate`, from which we can differentiate between src and dst node types by appending `_i` or `_j` to the variable name. In implementing GAT you will see how you can leverage accessing additional variables passed to propagate.\n",
    "\n",
    "  Critically, we emphasize that the output of the `message` function is a matrix of messages ready to be aggregated, having shape $[|\\mathcal{E}|, d]$, where these messages are constructed by applying different potential transformations to the initial src node embedding messages.\n",
    "\n",
    "  **Note** Understanding the message passing process is definitely a confusing concept; however, it is very helpful to think of the `message` function acting on each individual edges in the graph (i.e. producing a message for each directed edge $(j, i)$). Moreover, for undirected graphs since we store both directions of each edge, each node $u$ acts both as a src and dst node, sending messages to its neighbors and then also aggregating messages from its same set of neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. \n",
    "```\n",
    "def aggregate(self, inputs, index, dim_size = None):\n",
    "```\n",
    "Lastly, the `aggregate` function is used to aggregate the messages from neighboring nodes. Looking at the parameters, we highlight:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - `inputs` represents a matrix of the messages passed from neighboring nodes (i.e. the output of the `message` function).\n",
    "  - `index` is an array with length equal to the number of rows of `inputs` and tells us the central node $i$ associated with each message (row) in the `inputs` matrix. Thus, `index` tells us which rows / messages to aggregate for each central node $i$ - i.e. all messages with associated edges $(*, i) \\in \\mathcal{E}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "  The output of `aggregate` is of shape $[N, d]$.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Attention mechanisms have become the state-of-the-art in many sequence-based tasks such as machine translation and learning sentence representations. One of the major benefits of attention-based mechanisms is their ability to focus on the most relevant parts of the input to make decisions. In this problem, you will learn how attention mechanisms can be used to perform node classification over graph-structured data through the usage of Graph Attention Networks (GATs) ([Veličković et al. (2018)](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10903)).\n",
    "\n",
    "The building block of the Graph Attention Network is the graph attention layer, which is a variant of the aggregation function. Like before, a graph attention layer $l$ transforms the set of node features $\\mathbf{h^{l-1}} = \\{h_1^{l-1}, h_2^{l-1}, \\dots, h_N^{l-1}$\\}, $h_i^{l-1} \\in R^F$ $\\rightarrow$ $\\mathbf{h^{l}} = \\{h_1^{l}, h_2^{l}, \\dots, h_N^{l}$\\}, $h_i^{l} \\in R^{F'}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's see how this transformation is performed for each graph attention layer. First, a shared linear transformation parameterized by the weight matrix $\\mathbf{W} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{F' \\times F}$ is applied to every node. \n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we perform self-attention on the nodes using a shared attention function $a$:\n",
    "\\begin{equation} \n",
    "a : \\mathbb{R}^{F'} \\times \\mathbb{R}^{F'} \\rightarrow \\mathbb{R}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "that computes the attention coefficients, capturing the importance of node $j$'s features to node $i$:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "e_{ij} = a(\\mathbf{W_l}\\overrightarrow{h_i}, \\mathbf{W_r} \\overrightarrow{h_j})\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "The most general formulation of self-attention allows every node to attend to all other nodes, which drops all structural information. However, to utilize the graph structure in the attention mechanisms, we use **masked attention**. In masked attention, we only compute attention coefficients $e_{ij}$ for nodes $j \\in \\mathcal{N}_i$ where $\\mathcal{N}_i$ is the set of neighbors for node $i$ in the graph. Namely, we only compute attention along the edges of the graph. \n",
    "\n",
    "To easily compare coefficients across nodes, we normalize the coefficients across a node $i$'s neighbors $j$ using the softmax function:\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\alpha_{ij} = \\text{softmax}_j(e_{ij}) = \\frac{\\exp(e_{ij})}{\\sum_{k \\in \\mathcal{N}_i} \\exp(e_{ik})}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "For this problem, our attention mechanism $a$ will be a single-layer feedforward neural network parametrized by weight vectors $\\overrightarrow{a_l} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{F'}$ and $\\overrightarrow{a_r} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{F'}$, followed by a LeakyReLU nonlinearity (with negative input slope 0.2). Letting $\\cdot^T$ represent transposition, the coefficients computed by our attention mechanism may be expressed as:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "\\alpha_{ij} = \\frac{\\exp\\Big(\\text{LeakyReLU}\\Big(\\overrightarrow{a_l}^T \\mathbf{W_l} \\overrightarrow{h_i} + \\overrightarrow{a_r}^T\\mathbf{W_r}\\overrightarrow{h_j}\\Big)\\Big)}{\\sum_{k\\in \\mathcal{N}_i} \\exp\\Big(\\text{LeakyReLU}\\Big(\\overrightarrow{a_l}^T \\mathbf{W_l} \\overrightarrow{h_i} + \\overrightarrow{a_r}^T\\mathbf{W_r}\\overrightarrow{h_k}\\Big)\\Big)}\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For every GAT layer, after the attention coefficients are computed, the aggregation function for a node $i$ is computed as a weighted sum over the messages from neighboring nodes $j$ **weighted by the attention weights** $\\alpha_{ij}$. These aggregated features will serve as the final output features for every node.\n",
    "\n",

    "h_i' = \\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}_i} \\alpha_{ij} \\mathbf{W_r} \\overrightarrow{h_j}.\n",

    "\n",
    "At this point, we have covered a lot of information! Before reading further about multi-head attention, we encourage you to go again through the exercise of thinking about what components of the attention mechanism correspond with the different functions: 1) `forward`, 2) `message`, and 3 `aggregate`. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Hint 1: Our aggregation is very similar to that of GraphSage except now we are using sum aggregation.\n",
    "- Hint 2: The terms we aggregate over represent the individual message that each neighbor node j sends. Thus, we see that $\\alpha_{ij}$ is actually part of the message each node sends and should be computed during the message step. This makes sense since each attention weight is associated with a single edge in the graph.\n",
    "- Hint 3: Look at the terms in the definition of $\\alpha_{ij}$. What values can you pre-process and pass as parameters to the `propagate` function (i.e. those computed only over the nodes *that do not* require edge information). The parameters of `message(..., x_j, alpha_j, alpha_i, ...)` should give a good hint.  \n",
    "- Hint 4: Remember that parameters accessed in the `message` function are extracted from parameters passed to propagate using `edge_index`; thus, their first dimension has shape $|E|$.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Multi-Head Attention\n",
    "To stabilize the learning process of self-attention, you will use multi-head attention. To do this you use $K$ **independent** attention mechanisms, or ``heads'', to compute output features exactly as described in the above equations. Then, you simply concatenate these output feature representations:\n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\overrightarrow{h_i}' = ||_{k=1}^K \\Big(\\sum_{j \\in \\mathcal{N}_i} \\alpha_{ij}^{(k)} \\mathbf{W_r}^{(k)} \\overrightarrow{h_j}\\Big)\n",
    "\\end{equation}\n",
    "\n",
    "where $||$ is concatenation, $\\alpha_{ij}^{(k)}$ are the normalized attention coefficients computed by the $k$-th attention mechanism $(a^k)$, and $\\mathbf{W}^{(k)}$ is the corresponding input linear transformation's weight matrix. Note that for this setting, $\\mathbf{h'} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{KF'}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note:** We recommend first thinking through the implementation of single head attention. Switching to multi-head attention then requires thinking through adding an extra dimension $K$ to effectively compute $K$ separate single head attention outputs."

    "2. DeepSNAP standardizes the pipelines for node, edge, and graph-level prediction tasks under inductive or transductive settings. Specifically, DeepSNAP removes previous non-trivial / repetative design choices left to the user, such as how to split datasets. DeepSNAP thus greatly saves in coding efforts and enables fair model comparison.\n",
    "3. Many real-world graphs are heterogeneous in nature (i.e. include different node types or edge types). However, most packages lack complete support for heterogeneous graphs, including data storage and flexible message passing. DeepSNAP provides an efficient and flexible heterogeneous graph that supports both node and edge heterogeneity.\n",
